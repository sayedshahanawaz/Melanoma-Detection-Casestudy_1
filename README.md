# Melanoma-Detection-Casestudy_1

## Problem statement: 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
The data set contains the following diseases:

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion
- 
## Steps Involved
Data Reading/Data Understanding

## Dataset Creation

## Dataset visualisation

## Model Building & training : 
Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).
Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training

Train the model for ~20 epochs

Resolve underfitting/overfitting Model Building & training on the augmented data :

Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training

Train the model for ~20 epochs

Examine the current class distribution in the training dataset

Rectify class imbalances present in the training dataset with Augmentor library.

Create a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset. While building the model rescale images to normalize pixel values between (0,1).

Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
Train the model for ~30 epochs
